## Analysis

### Changelog
In progress: Collecting metrics, annotating, and merging BAMs with Picard.

2018-08-13: HMS approved my request for increased group space! `/n/data2/hms/genetics/cepko` has gone from 1 to 10 TB. Will set up shop in group for easier resource sharing and avoiding the auto-purge in scratch2.

2018-08-12: Initialized project README. Tested parameters for mapping NextSeq data. Finalized FastQC, Trimmomatic, and STAR multi-sample 2-pass mapping. Code refactoring.


### Pipelines
- [ ] In development: Genome-based mapping: STAR multi-sample 2-pass mapping -> featureCounts -> DESeq2. GNU Make and knitr
- [ ] *Hold: Genome-based mapping plus automated read count processing: (STAR) RSEM (used by Broad)*
- [ ] *Hold: Transcriptome-based mapping: (STAR vs. StringTie for identifying novel transcripts) -> Salmon -> tximport -> DESeq2*
	* https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/faq/


### FastQC and Trimmomatic
:exclamation:
 

### STAR mapping
Running STAR multi-sample 2-pass mapping, which increases sensitivity for novel splice junctions. From my understanding:

1. STAR is indexed with the published genome annotation, which identifies potential splice sites in the genome assembly.
1. STAR further detects and maps reads to novel splice junctions as it aligns, presumably based on a scoring system for the likelihood of novel splice junction vs. incorrect mapping. Due to this scoring system, reads with short overhangs (e.g. 5-10 bp) across the junctions are unlikely to be mapped to novel junctions.
1. Novel splice junctions that pass STAR's criteria for being legitimate (presumably based on the number and percentage of reads that mapped well across them) are outputted in a "SJ.out.tab" file.
1. Then it's possible to perform a second mapping pass with the SJ.out.tab files from the first mapping pass. In the second pass, STAR inserts the novel junctions into a private copy of the provided reference genome, then re-maps the reads against this personalized genome index.  This increases the sensitivity of read alignment to the novel junctions, presumably because the mapped reads are scored for "standard junction (reference genome) vs. incorrect mapping" rather than "novel junction vs. incorrect mapping."

From [STAR's publication](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/1/15/272537#84630902): 

>One of the main inherent problems of all de novo RNA-seq aligners is the inability to accurately detect splicing events that involve short (<5â€“10 nt) sequence overhangs on the donor or acceptor sides of a junction. This causes a significant underdetection of splicing events, and also increases significantly the misalignment rate, as such reads are likely to be mapped with a few mismatches to a similar contiguous genomic region. In addition, this effect also biases the alignments toward processed pseudogenes, which are abundant in the human genome. Similarly to other RNA-seq aligners, to mitigate this problem, STAR has an option to obtain information about possible splice junction loci from annotation databases (Supplementary Section 4). It is also possible to run a second mapping pass, supplying it with splice junction loci found in the first mapping pass. In this case, STAR will not discover any new junctions but will align spliced reads with short overhangs across the previously detected junctions.

There is the question of how accurately STAR detects novel junctions. The developers have some data for that in their paper, but the real reason I'm using it is that STAR is the most popular aligner in the RNA-seq world. It's also used by Broad for their RNA-seq analysis (albeit in the more convenient single-sample 2-pass instead of multi-sample 2-pass). Part of this is simply because STAR is blazingly fast, but if there were any glaring errors in its mapping method, I'm fairly sure they would have been noticed by now. 

I also think STAR is the most flexible aligner. The trend is to move towards *de novo* genome/transcriptome-based analysis, e.g. Tophat searches the transcriptome first, then maps to the genome only if it can't find a good match in the transcriptome. Kallisto and Salmon map solely to the transcriptome. 

In comparison, STAR's default approach is to map to the annotated reference genome, then split the read across the reference genome if it can't find a good contiguous match to see if it can discover a novel splice junction. The transcriptome-based approaches make theorectical sense--in RNA-seq, the transcriptome is what matters--but STAR's approach is probably more forgiving of less-well-annotated genomes, and it's possibly more accurate for calling uniquely mapping reads. (See https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/mapping-to-a-transcriptome-can-incorrectly-report-reads-as-mapping-uniquely/, with the counterpoint being at https://cgatoxford.wordpress.com/2016/08/17/why-you-should-stop-using-featurecounts-htseq-or-cufflinks2-and-start-using-kallisto-salmon-or-sailfish/.)

But STAR *also* has the option of providing transcriptome-based counts, so it fits easily into the transcriptome-based approach. Hence its flexibility.

As for 2-pass: I think that if someone is using STAR, they've already bought into its novel splice junction detection method, because it'll do that on every run anyway. If we don't believe in its novel junction detection method, we have to use a different aligner. If we do believe that STAR's novel junction detection is accurate, then 2-pass mapping is part of using STAR well.

(As a genome-based, splice-aware aligner, I think STAR's default output makes it a hybrid between reference and *de novo* genome assembly. See https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/56158/what-is-contigs-in-picards-reordersam.)


* Increasing mapping speed
	* To run this, I set STAR `--genomeLoad NoSharedMemory`. LoadAndRemove can be faster for the first pass, but it occasionally caused shared memory errors. For the second pass, junction insertion changes the genome, and I suspect that would also lead to shared memory errors.
	* With NoSharedMemory, every job needs ~30 GB of memory just to load the genome. I normally parallelize STAR mapping within each sample, but requesting 64+ GB of RAM significantly increases the amount of time a job spends in the queue. 
	* STAR itself is fast--mapping each read pair takes 2-20 minutes--so it's actually more efficient to loop through each read pair instead of parallelizing. This cuts the RAM requirement to what's necessary for mapping 1 read pair (I use 48 GB/job to be safe) instead of what would be necessary to map all the read pairs in parallel (e.g. 4 pairs per sample (from 4 flowcell lanes per pair) * >30 GB RAM = >120 GB RAM required). Less RAM/job required means faster job allocation from the queue.
	* Then I submit a job for each sample via job array. 
	* Average time for each pass across all samples is ~40-60 minutes, though it's taken >3 hours when the cluster is busy. (Like lab, equipment is most available during nights and weekends.)


### On mapping NextSeq reads
From STAR's output after the first pass, only ~20-25% of NextSeq reads are uniquely mapped vs. ~75-80% of HiSeq reads.

The NextSeq samples have ~40% of reads mapping "to too many loci" (>10 loci) vs 2-10% of HiSeq reads. NextSeq reads are also more likely to be unmapped due to being "too short" (e.g. 20% vs. 10%) or "other" (e.g. 15% vs. 2%). The second NextSeq batch has higher read counts, but the mapped proportions look the same.

Part of this is probably due to the NextSeq reads being 32 bp while the HiSeq are 50 bp + Galgal5 having only the toplevel genome assembly on Ensembl. Unlike primary assemblies, toplevel genome assemblies include haplotypes and repetitive patches. It's likely that the shorter reads map more easily to these repetitive regions.

I've tested the following:

1. Mapping reads to genomes indexed with `--sjdbOverhang 31` or `49` based on read length (default is 100, recommended is ((max read length)-1)).
	1. No effect.
1. Mapping only R1 reads to see if the sort order in paired FASTQ input was an issue (known STAR bug).
	1. No effect.
1. Relaxing the requirements for mapping length with `--outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0 --outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0 --outFilterMatchNmin 25`. The average input length for the PE is ~60 (2x32). STAR defaults map if read aligns to at least 2/3 of its total input length, so this allows reads that match on at least 25 bp instead of at least 40 bp to be mapped.
	1. ~4% more reads map uniquely instead of falling in the "too short" category. Makes sense but doesn't solve the problem.
1. Setting `--outFilterMultimapNmax 20` (default is 10, meaning that once a read maps to >10 loci, it's marked as mapping to too many.  20 is seen at https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/Bioinformatics_Pipelines/Expression_mRNA_Pipeline/).
	1. No effect.
1. Setting `--outFilterMultimapNmax 200`
	1. The "too many loci" reads are now "multiple loci" reads, which makes sense. Of course, this value is far too lenient, but good to know everything's working as expected.
1. Setting `--sjdbScore 1` (default is 2). This decreases mapping to splice junctions. From Alex Dobin (the developer of STAR) at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rna-star/O1oDItDltjY/0jSn0vy0ccgJ: "I think it is to be expected that some unique mappers become multi-mappers as you add more and more sjdb junctions, since this effectively adds more possibilities for the reads to align. Note, that by default the --sjdbScore = 2, which means that STAR will try to map aggressively to the sjdb junctions, preferring spliced alignment with 1 mismatch to an unspliced alignment without mismatches. You may want to try to reduce this parameter, though it will lead to yet another slight decrease in the % of unique mappers."
	1. No effect.

Unfortunately, I think these reads are genuinely mapping non-specifically. I'm tempted to relax the mapping length requirement, but quality > quantity. To be safe, I'll use the STAR defaults while using the genome index generated with `--sjdbOverhang 49` for processing all samples.

For future reference, excessive multimapping is likely due to:

1. Shorter read lengths + repetitive haplotypes/patches in the toplevel genome assembly and/or
1. rRNA "contamination" (poor ribo-depletion).

:star: **NOTE: On further thought, I think I also prefer using the toplevel assembly while viewing its repetitive regions as read sinks, and running STAR to exclude reads that map to too many loci.** It reduces the number of usable mapped reads, but it's also more conservative and reduces the risk of mapping reads incorrectly. Ideally, this would be with 2x100 (or 2x150) bp reads to maximize mapping accuracy. Then after mapping, reads that map primarily/strongly to problematic regions would be removed from downstream analysis. (This approach was also suggested by Babraham Bioinformatics, the devs of FastQC, at https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/genomic-sequence-not-in-the-genome-assembly-creates-mapping-artefacts/.)


### Thoughts on mapped data
NextSeq: The high percentage of reads that were "mapped to too many loci" in the first STAR pass seem to be split across "mapped to too many loci" and "reads unmapped: other" in the second STAR pass. But the percentage of uniquely mapped reads is stable (~20-25%), so that's probably fine.

HiSeq: There's a slight drop in uniquely mapping and rise in multimapping reads after the 2nd pass, which makes sense. It's a very minor shift (from ~75% to ~72%), so I would say these are also stable.

In terms of uniquely mapped reads, the NextSeq data consistently hovers around 0.5-1 M/BAM * 4 lanes = 2-4 M/sample.

From HiSeq, it's pretty variable, with the range being ~1-12 M/sample.

Ryoji's dendrogram seems to be based on log2+1 read counts, so I'd guess that's the main reason why the datasets looked so different? At any rate, all the samples have information. Will see how the analysis turns out.

## Cluster setup
The HMS O2 cluster has ~7000 nodes with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM each. It's managed by the [Slurm job scheduler](https://wiki.rc.hms.harvard.edu/display/O2/O2).

On Linux and Macs, log in from the terminal with `ssh <eCommons username>@o2.hms.harvard.edu`

My home directory is at `/home/ch220`, as ch220 is my eCommons username. Quota is 100 GB.

The Cepko Lab group folder is at `/n/data2/hms/genetics/cepko` As of 2018-08, its quota is 10 TB.

* Can request a max of 20 cores/node, but the more cores/memory requested, the longer the pend time.

* To run an interactive session, I usually use `srun --pty -p interactive -c 8 --mem=64G -t 0-11:00 /bin/bash`. The interactive queue has a max of 12 hours.

### Raw data
The raw data for this project can be found at:

* HMS Genetics server:  research.files.med.harvard.edu/genetics/Chick_Retina_Expression
* HMS O2:
	* I've symlinked Nathan's NextSeq data with:

		`ln -s /n/data2/hms/genetics/cepko/Nathan/NextSeq/150227_NS500531_0022_AH5JJLBGXX/Data/Intensities/BaseCalls/Run_22/* /home/ch220/2018_chickRFZ_rnaSeq/data/nathan/nextSeq_b1`

		(Symlinked directories can be deleted with `rm <name of link>`, no / at the end. `rm <name of link>/` will be interpreted as the actual directory, which is precious and needs to be left alone.)
	
	* I've uploaded Susana's HiSeq data to `/home/ch220/2018_chickRFZ_rnaSeq/data/susana/hiSeq`
* Dropbox (Susana)
* eCommons (Nathan)


#### Data format
* Paired end FASTQ files (R1 for forward read and R2 for reverse)
* FASTQ files are compressed as necessary by gunzip
* Each sample (unique combination of tissue and biological replicate) has its own folder
* Initial scripts format Hiseq filenames into the NextSeq naming syntax: 
	* `tissue-replicate-well_sampleNumber_laneNumber_R1orR2_batchNumber.fastq.gz`
	* E.g. `Sample1.1/RFZ-1-A01_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`
	* E.g. `Sample2.2/D-1-A02_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`
* Paired end reads are matched by lane assuming that lane regex is `_L###_`


---

## Scripting tips
* Be organized and consistent, especially with naming syntax. 
	* It's always worthwhile to make all your initial data files have a consistent, group-aware, and as-simple-as-possible filename syntax. Usually it's best to name from the most to least general characteristic. 
	* `tissue-replicate-well_sampleNumber_laneNumber_R1orR2_batchNumber` works well (as does `tissue-condition-replicate-well_sampleNumber_laneNumber_R1orR2_batchNumber`).

* Immediately strip whitespace from folder and filenames, and avoid having spaces in names as much as possible.
	* If this is infeasible, seriously consider coding in Python instead of bash. Bash wasn't developed for handling whitespace (but I still think it's a wonderful and under-appreciated language).

* Write in an editor with syntax highlighting. I usually write bash in gedit and R in RStudio, but probably any editor with syntax highlighting will do.

* Use [tmux](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058) for interactive scripting.

* Use variables to minimize code duplication and set custom parameters. Keep them at the beginning of your scripts. Then later, when you need to change them, you won't have to hunt through your entire pipeline to find them all.

* Write scripts to be as modular and reusable as possible.

* Put `set -Eeuo pipefail` at the beginning of every bash script. See https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/ and http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/.

* Use `sacct -j <jobid>` to check whether jobs completed successfully. ExitValues should be 0:0.

* Remember version control with [GitHub](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html).


### Bash commands
Common bash commands include:

* `cd <target dir>`: Change directory
	* Press tab to auto-complete a name, and press tab twice to see potential auto-complete options.
	* `cd ..`: Move up one directory
* `ls`: List contents of current directory
	* `ls *.bam > bams.txt`: List contents of current directory if it ends in ".bam" and write output to bams.txt
* `cat <file name>`: Display contents of file
* `head <file name>`: Display the first 10 lines of a file
* `mkdir <directory name>:` Make a new directory
* `mv -i <old file> <new file>`: Move a file or folder from one location to another, with a prompt if moving will overwrite a file. Also used for renaming.


### Parallelization
Job arrays parallelize across nodes. GNU Parallel parallelizes across cores.

I often use job arrays for between-sample analyses and GNU Parallel for within-sample analyses.

* Why?
	* A cluster is a collection of nodes. On HMS O2, each node has 32 cores and 256G memory.
	* This can also be said as, "A network is a collection of computers. On HMS O2, each computer has 32 threads and 256 GB RAM."
	* Each job is sent to 1 node (unless you're using mpi. That's all you).
	* Keep this structure in mind when parallelizing. You want to parallelize in a way that's analogous to the organization of your data.
	* Say you have ten donors, and you're analyzing all the chromosomes per donor. Each donor has their own folder named with a unique number, but their chromosomes have the same name (so both donor 1 and donor 2 have chr2). It's often a great idea to submit a job per donor, then within that job, simultaneously process the different chromosomes on different cores. On the other hand, submitting a job per chromosome while trying to analyze the different donors on different cores will generally make a mess.
		* Of course, submitting a job per chromosome while analyzing different donors across cores is possible. It all depends on how you've organized and annotated your data.

* Caveats
	* Jobs that require a large number of cores/memory (>8 cores and/or >48 GB RAM) can spend a long time languishing in the queue. Sometimes it's faster to reduce memory requirements by looping instead of parallelizing.
	* When a script generates large intermediate files (e.g. STAR), available disk space can become a limiting factor. Then it may be worthwhile to limit the number of jobs allowed to run from a job array at a time.
